# Bias analysis

## Assemblage similarity



## Size distributions

### Note (for files names)
A = my assemblage (Resamples)
B = Buckley's assemblage
C = ForCenS
L = LGM data


### Folder morpho_bias_raw

Raw measurements for the bias analysis of the Henry Buckley Collection of Planktonic Foraminifera

Files named “bias_X.xlsx” are measurements of the forams picked by me (re-sampled sediments). The number X refers to the sample number (same as the sample numbers in the size-distrib-forams project). Each file contains the measurements of all species (each tab is one species) also picked/identified by Buckley for the given sample X. These files include more species than the ones used for the size-distrib-forams project, for example, glutinata.

Files named with the species, e.g. “glutinata.xlsx”, are measurements of the slides of the Buckley Collection. Here, each tab is one sample/slide (identified by the ZFs number). These measurements were done for the bias analysis; they include species that I picked in the re-sampled sediments that were also identified by Buckley but not measured by me for the size-distrib-forams project. 

### Folder morpho_bias_buckley

All these files are separated into individual files in the folder "morpho_bias_buckley". The files are named speciesXA.csv or speciesXB.csv, X being the sample number, A refers to measurements from re-sampled sediments, B refers to measurements from the Buckley Collection slides

### Folder morpho_R
All files from "morpho_bias_buckley" plus measurments from the size-distrib-forams project (subset of morpho_buckley.csv, just the samples used in the biis analysis)
