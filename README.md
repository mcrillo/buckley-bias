# Quantifying biases in museum collections

Henry Buckley Collection of Planktonic Foraminifera

The two main potential sources of bias are taxonomic bias (systematic misidentification or incomplete representation of the assemblage) and size bias (bias towards larger specimens or larger lineages). The recognition of the biases in the Buckley collection will be placed together with the collection at the NHMUK Data Portal, and will be valuable for other researchers that want to use it in the future.
